Eat, Sleep, Spaghetti, repeat. This project is about learning how threads work by precisely timing a group of philosophers on when to pick up forks and eat spaghetti without dying from hunger, I learned how to create threads manage them and definitely how to perfectly use mutexes to succeed this project.
